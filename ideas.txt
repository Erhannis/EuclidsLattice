Simplify Mesh function?
give points a set of all allowed neighbors? (particularly for function meshes)
  would speed up crystallization
  and also make it more stable
let Lattice form single out an element and zoom to it (hiding others) on the display
when you add a binding function or shape, you could also update a partitioning/raster of space, indicating how far it is to the closest binding surface, and in which direction.  When updating it, minimum distance overwrites the existing one.
incorporate a distributed computing library
customize number of colored cells, or maybe a fraction rather than count
points with faces >= 1, if all faces are complete, are themselves complete, and not available to add cells to.  Do I use this info?
axis-aligned default view rotations
* I suspect that there is something wrong with my crystallization algorithm; I think it's crystallizing things it shouldn't, which leads it into a dead end.
